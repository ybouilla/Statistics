\# Common test statistics



\# Reminder: p-value



The p-value is the probability under the null hypothesis of obtaining a real-valued test statistic at least as extreme as the one obtained





\## 1. Student t-test:



Compare mean of 2 différents populations

Assumptions: populations are iid, follow normal distribution and have similar variances

H0: populations have the same mean

H1/ populations have 2 different means



If population don 't follow normal distribution, one can use Welch t-test



\## 2. F-test



Compare variances of 2 différents population



Assumptions:



H0: populations have the same variance

H1: population have different variance
